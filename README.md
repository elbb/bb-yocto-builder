# embedded linux building block template

this code serves as a template for the creation of further building blocks with the purpose of giving all blocks a uniform structure and usage.

## using dobi for local build

dobi should only be used via the `dobi.sh` script, because there important variables are set and the right scripts are included.

By default three dobi resouces are defined (but not implemented):

```sh
./dobi.sh build  # build the buildingblock
./dobi.sh test   # run all tests
./dobi.sh deploy # deploy the buildingblock
```

these point to the resources defined in dobi.yaml
the separation between meta.yaml and dobi.yaml is necessary to integrate the building block into another building block via dobi.

# What is embedded linux building blocks

embedded linux building block's is a project to create reusable and
adoptable blueprints for highly recurrent issues in building an internet
connected embedded linux system.

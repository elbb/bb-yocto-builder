# (e)mbedded (l)inux (b)uilding (b)locks - containerized yocto builder environment

This building block provides a way to build your yocto project either locally with dobi or via ci/cd concourse pipeline.
It contains an example to build a "dunfell" poky/openembedded yocto image.

## dunfell poky/openembedded integration

We
```sh
git remote add poky https://git.yoctoproject.org/git/poky
git subtree add --prefix yocto/poky poky dunfell --squash
git remote add meta-openembedded https://github.com/openembedded/meta-openembedded.git
git subtree add --prefix yocto/meta-openembedded meta-openembedded dunfell --squash

```

## using dobi for local build

dobi should only be used via the `dobi.sh` script, because there important variables are set and the right scripts are included.

By default three dobi resources are predefined (but not implemented):

```sh
./dobi.sh build  # build the buildingblock
./dobi.sh test   # run all tests
./dobi.sh deploy # deploy the buildingblock
```

These point to the resources defined in dobi.yaml.
The separation between meta.yaml and dobi.yaml is necessary to integrate the building block into another building block via dobi.

Version informations are generated automatically from git history by using building block bb-gitversion (<https://github.com/elbb/bb-gitversion>).
